Working through another flask login project to see if this can help me understand what went wrong in my previous repo. 
Will see what we can learn from this one.

The article writer's github repo is:
https://github.com/ondiekelijah/User-Authentication-in-Flask

Completed items:
1. Create better User model for db that would include a number of different features for a user.
2. Created database_baseline.db with a default user and password. 

Current TODO list:


3. Create an Admin panel that will allow admins to administrate users. (On deck after item 6)
4. Improve default page with name of application.
5. Do some UX work to make this look more unique for a login page.
6. Create a user page. This will be a landing page for a logged in user. (in progress)
