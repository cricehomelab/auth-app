Working through another flask login project to see if this can help me understand what went wrong in my previous repo. 
Will see what we can learn from this one.

The article writer's github repo is:

Current goals:

1. Create better User model for db that would include a number of different features for a user.
2. Create an Admin panel that will allow admins to activate de-activate different features.
3. Improve default page with name of application. 
4. Do some UX work to make this look more unique for a login page.
5. Create a user page.
