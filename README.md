Working through another flask login project to see if this can help me understand what went wrong in my previous repo. 
Will see what we can learn from this one.

The article writer's github repo is:
https://github.com/ondiekelijah/User-Authentication-in-Flask

Current goals:

1. Create better User model for db that would include a number of different features for a user.
2. Create an Admin panel that will allow admins to activate de-activate different features.
3. Work out a way to plug in different features to the tool.
